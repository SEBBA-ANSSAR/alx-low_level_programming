0x08. C - Recursion
   tasks
	0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget 
by using a prototype void _puts_recursion(char *s);
	1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together and use a prototype void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
	2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange and use a prototype int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
	3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling and use a prototype int factorial(int n);
	4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate and use a prototype int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
	5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer and use a prototype int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
	6. Inception. Is it possible?
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0. and use a prototype int is_prime_number(int n);
	7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything and use a prototype int is_palindrome(char *s);
	8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible... and use aprototype int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
